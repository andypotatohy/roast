Known issues:

On Ubuntu 16.04, sometimes the Matlab C++ library conflicts with the system C++ library. You may get error message like "MATLAB_INSTALLATION/sys/os/glnxa64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found".

Temporary solution: You can set up the environment variable before launching Matlab by doing something like "export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6". But you have to do this every time before you start Matlab.

Permanent solution: Make sure your Ubuntu is up to date by doing "apt-get update" and "apt-get upgrade". Then you can rename the libstdc++ under Matlab directory to something else (e.g. libstdc++.so.6_bak) so that Matlab will be forced to use the latest system libstdc++ library.
