% CVX_CLEAR   Clears all active CVX data.
%    CVX_CLEAR clears the current CVX model in progress. This is useful if, for
%    example, you have made an error typing in your model and wish to start 
%    over. Typing this before entering another CVX_BEGIN again avoids the 
%    warning message that occurs if CVX_BEGIN detects a model in progress.
