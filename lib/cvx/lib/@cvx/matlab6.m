%CVX: Matlab 6 compatability functions.
%   This directory contains definitions for 'true' and 'false'. These
%   functions are used extensively in CVX, and are built in for MATLAB
%   6.5 and later. For MATLAB 6.1 we supply these surrogates. It is
%   *very* important, however, that this directory NOT be placed in
%   the MATLAB search path for older versions of MATLAB.
