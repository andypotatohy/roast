% compvar()   - project selected components and compute the variance of
%               the original data they account for.
%
% Usage:
%   >> [proj, variance] = compvar( data, wts_or_act, winv, components);
%
% Required Inputs:
% data        - 2-D (channels, points) or 3-D (channels, frames, trials)
%               data array.
% wts_or_act  - {sphere weights} cell array containing the ICA sphere 
%               and weights matrices. May also be a 2-D (channels, points) 
%               or 3-D (channels, frames, trials) array of component 
%               activations.
% winv        - inverse or pseudo-inverse of the product of the weights
%               and sphere matrices returned by the ICA decompnumsition,
%               i.e., inv(weights*sphere) or pinv(weights*sphere).
% components  - array of component indices to back-project
%
% Outputs:
%  proj       - summed back-projections of the specified components
%  pvaf       - percent variance of the data that the selected 
%               components account for (range: 100% to -Inf%).
